Workplace Scheduling Algorithm

This code will give employers a way of scheduling their employee's shifts with individual and group holidays in Python. It was created to be an operating room scheduling tool, but it can be applied in many other ways.

It allows multiple-month schedules to be made with individual and group holidays. The holidays can be filled with other workers' shifts and will be balanced so that by the end of the given time period, all workers will work similar amounts of shifts. It can be modified to whatever length of a schedule you want, and however many workers are needed. 

To run this code you will need to download calendar, pandas, difflib, and operator modules (which can be done with pip).
